		portable_operating_systems.txt 
		code_optimization_for_space_efficiency.txt
		parallel_algorithms.txt
	c) Relevance file:-
		relevance.txt : Downloaded from the link provided
	d) results.txt:- 
		Contains results form for all three given queries, and prints following attributes-
			Name of the Query and Query ID 
				Rank
				Document ID

2. HOW TO RUN PROGRAM - 
	python hw5.py > results.txt

3. Precision @ 20
	For Query ID 12 - precision at 20 = 0.2
	For Query ID 13 - precision at 20 = 0.2
	For Query ID 19 - precision at 20 = 0.35
	This is also present at the end of every table for each query in results.txt

4. MAP = 0.433261712221
   This is also present at the end of the results.txt file.
